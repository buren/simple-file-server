simple-file-server
==================

A very simple node.js file server that can be installed on any machine running node.js.
The server will
1. Create a nice html view of your file structure (using express.js directory filter). You can then click any file to open using your browser default file handler (e.g. streaming videos, watch photos, read pdfs etc.). You can also right click the file and select "save as..." to download the file to a local folder.
2. Provide all the files using standard HTTP GET.
